    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What could possibly make a spinach feta dip even more fantastic? 
            Two things: one, adding a secret cheese ingredient (okay, it’s cottage cheese) that adds protein and keeps it from being too rich; and two, having the dippers bake in the very same pan. Smart, right?
             Welcome to my better-than-ever Spinach Feta Skillet Dip.
        </p>
        <p>First, why cottage cheese? While most spinach dips are laden with cream cheese and mayo, this one gets its creaminess
            from protein-packed cottage cheese. Not only does this keep the dip from tasting too rich, it’s also the dairy product 
            you’re more likely to keep on hand (and so easy to grab at any store). 
            Briny, tangy feta and freshly-grated Parm round out the cheesy flavors and textures.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoonsextra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed very dry</li>
            <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced, dark green parts reserved</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk cottage cheese </li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 16-ounce (8 count) can refrigerated biscuits</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet (such as cast-iron) over medium heat until shimmering. Add spinach and white and light-green parts of scallions and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool slightly while you wipe out the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add cottage cheese, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, red pepper flakes, several grinds black pepper, 3/4 cup feta cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the bowl with the spinach; stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Brush the skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cut each biscuit in half to form 16 pieces and roll into balls. Arrange around the rim of the skillet. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Set the dip in the center of the skillet and top with the remaining feta. Sprinkle the entire skillet (including the rolls) with remaining Parmesan cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Top with reserved scallion greens, several grinds black pepper, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
