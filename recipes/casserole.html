    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You'll love this grits casserole with ground sausage and cheese, especially if you're from the South. When I cook it, I place it in the slow cooker to stay warm. There is nothing worse than cold grits for breakfast!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked grits</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; stir in grits. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until liquid has been absorbed, about 5 minutes. Mix in 2 cups Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the butter until melted.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and add to grits mixture.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet used to cook the sausage. Lightly scramble eggs over medium-low heat, then mix into grits mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour grits mixture into the prepared baking dish. Dot with remaining butter, sprinkle with remaining 1 cup Cheddar, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
